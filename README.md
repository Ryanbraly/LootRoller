# LootRoller
A CTK / Python / proc gen learning project styled around a dungeon crawling game 


This was a sekf-directed learning project as part of Boot.Dev's curriculum - specifically the first of the Personal Project modules.
I wanted to do something game-related, largely because I thought it'd be fun to come up with new mechanics and methods of executing them, but also because I figured a procedural generation system would be a good way to take relatively little code (ie many small item components) and programitically combined them into many possible outcomes - lots of content for comparatively little input.
